# Learning JS Day-5

Day 5 Contain 8 Files and That FIles Contain Diffrent Problems And There Solution.

## Simple Substring Search: 

Write a function that takes a string and a substring as parameter.
It should print true if the substring is found anywhere in the string, false otherwise.


## Removing a Character or Substring:

Create a function that takes a string and a character as a parameter (Two Parameters).
print a new string with the first occurrence of the character removed.


## Case-Insensitive Search:

Create a function that takes two parameter
first param is string with all lowercase
second param is search string with all uppercase 
Using this two parameters found second param string from first string using case sensitive


## Remove All Occurrences of a Substring:

Write a function that takes a string and a substring as parameters
If the substring parameter value is found on the main string parameter then remove the substring value on main string and print new string in console.


for example. 

const testString = "This is a test string"; 
const subStr = "is";

removeSubstring(testString, subStr) 

subStr  value is remove on testString and print new value like "Th  a test string" 

remove all is  from testString.

## Check for All Elements in Another Array

Create two arrays like that 
const colors1 = ["red", "green", "blue"]; 
const colors2 = ["blue", "red", "purple"];  
After that write a function allElementsExist(colors1, colors2) using these two parameters.
This function takes two arrays as input and prints true if all elements of the first array exist in the second array (regardless of order), otherwise false. Utilize a loop and the includes() method.

## Remove Duplicates (Using includes())

Create an array like this const numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1]; 
Write a function that takes an array as parameter and print a new array containing only unique elements (removing duplicates). Implement a loop and includes() to check for existing elements before adding.
Final result will be console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]


## Replace All Occurrences

Create a variable like that const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]; 
Write a function that takes an numbers, a value to replace, and a new value as a parameter. 
Like replac1zeAll(numbers, 2, 5); a
It should modify the original array, replacing all occurrences of the old value with the new value.
For example we have array like numbers  variable 
and function second parameter is old value like 2 number 
and function 3rd parameter is new number
so function can do this is in number  on every places found 2 number then this 2 number should be replaced to with new number 5
Final result will be console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 5, 3, 5, 4] 
 
 ## Create to do list

 Create a Input for typing a value
Create a button so if user type any value and then click on button then this value show below of the button
Show alert if click on button without typing any value
Show all value below of the button
