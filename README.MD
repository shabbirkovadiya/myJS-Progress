## Greet by Name

Create a function greet(name).
Inside the function, print a greeting message using the name parameter.
Call the function with different argument values (e.g., greet("Alice"), greet("Bob")).


console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");


## Dynamic Counter

Have a button that, when clicked, increments a counter displayed on console log.  You'll need a function to handle the incrementing and updating the display


## Person Profile

Create variable with object 
add two key like first name and last name

Create a function for create full name 
for example object first name is Raju  and last name  Sharma then concat this first and last name and console log the full name like  The full name is Raju Sharma  

Create a button to execute this function.

## Even or Odd:

Create any variable with number
Create function and check this variable number is even or odd
Print result in console is number is Odd     console.log("The number is odd.");  
Print result in console is number is Even console.log("The number is even.");  
Create button and add on click event this created function.

Note - first understand what is odd and even numbers. 


## Grade Calculator

Create variable and assign any numbers between 0 to 100
Create a function for check what grade based on variable value.
Calculation Grade 
A: 90-100
B: 80-89

C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59
If user enter number of 100 plus then show message like this is not valid numbers
all grade should be print in console
Create a button for calling function


## Power of a Number

Create a function calculatePower(base, exponent).
This function takes two arguments: base and exponent.
Inside the function, use a exponential (for a challenge) to calculate base raised to the power of exponent.
log the calculated power.
Call the function with different values for base and exponent.


## Function parameter and argument


Create a function that's take two parameter and this function need to concat this parameter and log result like The concat is 15 

pass argument when function calls

## Check Positive, Negative and Zero number

Create a variable with any number.
Create a function that check this variable  number is negative, positive or zero
If number is zero then print   console.log("The number is zero."); 
if number is positive then print  console.log("The number is positive ."); 
if number is negative then print console.log("The number is negative ."); 
Create a button and on click event to call the function

## Check discount based on age

Create object with name and age value.
Create a function check discount based on age
Discount based on age
if age is between 40 to 50 then user get 40% discounts
if age is between 30 to 40then user get 30% discounts
if age is between 20 to 30 then user get 20% discounts
if age is between 0 to 20 then user get 10% discounts
if age is more then 50 +then user not able to get any discount
Show message on console if eligible discount like Raju, you are eligible for a 10% discount! 
if not eligible for discount then show Raju, sorry, no discount available. 
Click button should create function.

## Admission Check

Create variables age and hasTicket.
let age = 15
let hasTicket = false.
Change variable value accordingly 
Create a function and call oncliking button
inside this function using a if statement with the && operator, log "Welcome!" if the person is over 18 and has a ticket. Otherwise, log "Sorry, you cannot enter."

## Flavor Choice

Create variables likesChocolate and likesVanilla
let likesChocolate = false;
let likesVanilla = true;

se a switch statement to output a message: 
"Excellent" for 'A'
"Good" for 'B'
"Satisfactory" for 'C'

6, 7, 8: "Summer"
9, 10, 11: "Autumn"
Include a default case for an invalid month number.




## Truthy/Falsy Check:

Write a function isTruthy(value) that takes a value as input and print true if it's truthy, and false if it's falsy.
